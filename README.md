# Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data it involves formulating two competing hypotheses a null hypothesis h 0 and an alternative hypothesis ha and then using sample data to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
here s a breakdown of the process : 

1. Null Hypothesis (H0): This is the default or initial assumption, often representing no effect, no difference, or no change in a specific parameter or relationship. It is what you aim to test against.

2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): This is the statement you want to support or prove. It represents the opposite of the null hypothesis and typically suggests that there is a significant effect, difference, or relationship.

3. Test Statistic: A test statistic is a numerical value calculated from sample data. It quantifies the difference between what is observed in the sample and what is expected under the null hypothesis.

4. Significance Level (α): This is the chosen level of significance, which determines the threshold for considering a result statistically significant. Common values for α include 0.05 and 0.01.

5. P-Value: The p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as those observed in the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than α) suggests that the data provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

6. Decision: Based on the p-value and the chosen significance level, you decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it.

# Z-Test
The z test is a hypothesis test used when you have a large enough sample typically n 30 and you want to test a hypothesis about the population mean when the population standard deviation is known it is often used in situations where you want to compare a sample mean to a known population mean.
The formula for the z test statistic is as follows :

Once you calculate the z test statistic you can compare it to the critical z value from a z table or use a statistical calculator to find the p value if the p value is less than your chosen significance level you would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis
